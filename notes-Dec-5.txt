1. Don't actually need to use image files -- possible to look up index directly so the interpolation is really easy. This way we can use doubles.

2. Need to put 1-d interpolator code directly into the kernel, possible to use subroutines, etc.

3. There is a reduction operation (checking market clearing). Possible to use tools from today's lecture?
